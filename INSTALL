4. Some build notes about configure arguments

4.1. Notes for Xft support

If you've installed Xft and freetype NCWM will build with
Xft support by default. If Xft is not installed NCWM won't
build with Xft support. If you explicitly don't want Xft
support, although having Xft installed just use following
configure argument:

./configure --without-xft

4.2. Notes for stacked tabbing

NCWM supports stacked tabbing with stack-alike visual
feedback within frame bars, groups and pagers. This feature
is not seen in any other window manager but disabled by
default. It's highly recommended to give it a try. All
focussed clients, groups, workspaces are arranged in
stacking order from left to right, the topmost element
is arranged leftwards and the bottom element is arranged
rightwards.
This results that the focussed element (e.g. a client in
a frame bar or group bar) appears always left, thus the
focus never changes, but the titles and order.
Just use following configure argument:

./configure --with-stacked-tabbing

4.3. Notes for debug support

To run NCWM with verbose debug output you've to configure it
with debug support:

./configure --with-debug

4.4. Notes for diamond box

By default NCWM draws a diamond box while resizing/moving
clients. If you don't like drawing the diamond box you
can disable it using:

./configure --without-diamond

4.5. Notes for disabling the slot

By default NCWM is built with slot support.
If you don't need it you can disable it using:

./configure --without-slot


5. Start NCWM

to your $HOME/.xinitrc:

# startx

afterwards to launch X and the NCWM.
